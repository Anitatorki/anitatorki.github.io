# Anita Torki's Portfolio

Hello, I'm Anita Torki, a passionate front-end developer with a keen interest in Data Science applied to Psychology Research. This portfolio is a representation of my journey, skills, and the projects I've had the privilege to work on.

## About Me

Every day is a chance to explore the depths of the mind and innovate with purpose!

As a software engineer with a background in psychology, I excel in tackling complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. My experience spans full stack development (front-end and back-end), machine learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and applying psychological principles to technology.

I craft innovative solutions that blend technical expertise with a deep understanding of human behavior, aiming to bridge the gap between technology and human insight.
